### Advanced CSS and SASS Flexbox Practice

This project was created as part of a practice exercise during my college course. It is based on the Udemy course **Advanced CSS and SASS: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!** by Jonatan Schmedtmann.

The Trillo project is a single-page web application designed to practice and demonstrate the use of advanced CSS and SASS techniques, with a particular focus on Flexbox.
